  <summary>Blocked Keyword Finder (Only tested with goguardian)</summary>
  <p>1. Navigate to chrome://history or press ctrl+h.</p>
  <p>2. Enter in any keyword into the history search bar.</p>
  <p>3. If the history page turns into a blocked page, then that keyword is blocked.</p>
  <P>Note: You want to use chrome://history instead of searching a keyword on google because they can't see what you search in chrome://history.</P>

  <summary>Disable tab limit</summary>
  <p>Note 1: Only tested for goguardian.</p>
  <p>Note 2: You need to do the steps again if goguardian disconnects then reconnects.</p>
  <p>Note 3: This works with any website that when trying to close says "are you sure you want to leave this site?"</p>
  <p>Note 3.1: Websites that show the message: Iready, The home page for this site</p>
  <p>Note 4: Skip steps 1 and 2 if using a different website than Iready.</p>
  <p>Note 4.1: If using Iready fothis and the Iready tab shows the alert, it still works.</p>
  <p>1. Open Iready</p>
  <p>2. Get onto a mypath lesson</p>
  <p>3. You need to make sure you have as many tabs open as it will allow you to before doing this next step</p>
  <p>4. Make sure the Iready (or other website) tab is at the end of all of your tabs</p>
  <p>5. Right-click on the tab before Iready (or other website) and press "new tab to the right"</p>
  <p>6. If you did all the steps correctly, it should bring you to the Iready tab (or other website) and ask you if you want to leave the site</p>
  <p>7. Press cancel when it asks you</p>
  <P>8. You are now able to open infinite tabs! You can even close the Iready (or other website) tab too.</P>
